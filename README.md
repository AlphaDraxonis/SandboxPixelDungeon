With Sandbox Pixel Dungeon, you can design your very own dungeon layouts effortlessly. Use randomly generated levels as templates, providing a starting point for your grand designs. No need to start from scratch when you have the foundations of exciting and challenging levels at your fingertips!

Craft a meticulously detailed dungeon by placing tiles wherever you desire. Create a labyrinth of corridors, rooms filled with treasures, or devious traps lying in wait. The choice is yours, limited only by your imagination!

Challenge players to think strategically, adapt, and emerge victorious against the cunning foes lurking in your carefully crafted dungeon. With Sandbox Pixel Dungeon, unleash your creativity and bring your dungeon to life with creatures that will test the limits of even the most seasoned adventurers.

Tailor the item placement to create unique challenges for brave adventurers. Experiment with weapons, adjusting their upgrades, curses, enchantments, or glyphs to create the perfect balance of risk and reward. Although customizing armor sets is not currently supported, you can still shape the loot and rewards found within your dungeon, ensuring players are tested to their limits.

When you're ready to share your creation, you can export your dungeon as JSON, capturing the most important dungeon settings. However, for a more immersive experience with your mod, players can utilize the raw files that you share to truly delve into the world you've built.

It's remarkable to consider that this mod was developed in just 1.5 months by a dedicated single developer and many more future updates with additional features will come to this incredible project.
